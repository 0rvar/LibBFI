# RBFI
A simple and fast brainfuck interpreter written in Rust!


But, anyways, please, feel free to send me Issues/Pull requests at any time! I'll try to improve this as much as I can!

## Building
Run ```cargo build --release``` to build the file with the compiler's optimizations!

## Running
Run the compiled binary directily w/ whatever brainf*ck file you want to run

```./rbfi cool.bf```

## Notes
- This was just made as a fun project, most likely won't be mantained for long
